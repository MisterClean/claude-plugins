## Banned Phrases

### The "It's not X, it's Y" Construction
Never use this formula. It's become a cliché that signals AI writing.

❌ "It's not just a product, it's a lifestyle"
❌ "It's not a tool, it's a partner"
❌ "It's not about X, it's about Y"

→ Just state what it is. Let readers draw conclusions.

### Throat-Clearing Openers
Delete these entirely—start with your actual point:

❌ "In today's fast-paced world..."
❌ "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
❌ "In the realm of..."
❌ "It's no secret that..."
❌ "It goes without saying..."
❌ "It's important to note that..."
❌ "Let's face it..."
❌ "Here's the thing..."
❌ "At the end of the day..."
❌ "When it comes to..."
❌ "Now more than ever..."
❌ "In an age where..."

### False Personalization
These feel hollow because they are:

❌ "Whether you're a [X] or a [Y]..."
❌ "No matter where you are on your journey..."
❌ "Whatever your [noun], we've got you covered"
❌ "For those who [vague description]..."

→ Be specific about who you're talking to, or don't segment at all.

### Hollow Enthusiasm
Excitement that adds nothing:

❌ "We're thrilled to announce..."
❌ "We're excited to share..."
❌ "We're proud to present..."
❌ "We can't wait for you to..."

→ Just announce it. The news should carry its own weight.

### Question Openers (Rhetorical Crutches)
Often lazy and presumptuous:

❌ "Ever wondered why...?"
❌ "What if you could...?"
❌ "Tired of...?"
❌ "Ready to...?"
❌ "Looking for...?"

→ These can work occasionally, but AI overuses them. Use sparingly.

### Empty Superlatives
Claims that mean nothing without evidence:

❌ "best-in-class"
❌ "world-class"
❌ "industry-leading"
❌ "top-tier"
❌ "next-level"
❌ "state-of-the-art"
❌ "unparalleled"
❌ "second to none"

→ Replace with specific proof or delete.

### Corporate Filler
Phrases that pad word count without adding meaning:

❌ "at the end of the day"
❌ "move the needle"
❌ "low-hanging fruit"
❌ "circle back"
❌ "touch base"
❌ "take it to the next level"
❌ "think outside the box"
❌ "hit the ground running"
❌ "on the same page"

## Banned Patterns

### The Triple Stack
Listing three adjectives or benefits in a row:

❌ "Fast, reliable, and secure"
❌ "Simple, powerful, and intuitive"
❌ "Fresh, bold, and innovative"

→ Pick the one that matters most. Or be specific about each.

### The Colon Reveal
Using a colon for fake drama:

❌ "The result: unprecedented growth"
❌ "The secret: consistency"
❌ "Our mission: to transform..."

→ Integrate into natural sentences.

### The "Imagine" Opening
❌ "Imagine a world where..."
❌ "Picture this:..."

→ Overused. Describe the reality instead.

### The Future Promise
❌ "The future of [X] is here"
❌ "[X] reimagined"
❌ "[X] redefined"

→ Say what's actually new or different.

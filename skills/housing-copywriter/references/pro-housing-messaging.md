# Pro-Housing Messaging Guide

Research-backed messaging frameworks from Welcoming Neighbors Network, Sightline Institute, and Parking Reform Network. Based on national surveys, qualboards, focus groups, and randomized controlled trials.

## The Pro-Housing Framework

Use this 5-step structure for housing advocacy content:

### 1. Meet people where they are: COSTS ARE TOO HIGH
High costs are the key entry point. Leading with costs establishes common ground across identities and ideologies.

Example: "Housing is too unaffordable today because there are not enough homes to rent or buy that meet people's needs and budgets."

### 2. Use COMPETITION to connect costs to shortages
People don't grasp "supply and demand" economics, but they understand competition from daily life—wait lists, bidding wars, being outbid.

Example: "Not having enough homes to rent or buy creates cutthroat competition and drives up prices."

### 3. Emphasize the PEOPLE AFFECTED in our communities now
Focus on sympathetic community members hurt by the shortage. Shift from housing structures to benefits for people.

Example: "Right now, people our communities rely on—like teachers, childcare workers, and service and retail workers—can't find homes they can afford in the places they serve."

### 4. Be SPECIFIC AND CONCRETE when presenting changes
Jargon and abstractions cause fear. Voters respond to specific, familiar home types and discrete regulatory fixes.

Example: "We can allow smaller homes to be built on small lots to create affordable starter homes, and we can make it legal to convert a basement or garage into an apartment for a family member or caregiver to live in or to rent out."

### 5. Highlight how more home choices BENEFIT PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES
Paint a compelling picture of positive outcomes. Create emotional response by showing how lives will improve.

Example: "A mix of homes, of all sizes and prices, will give more people a chance to own their home, build wealth, and provide solid foundations of economic stability and opportunity for themselves and the next generation."

## The Parking Flexibility Framework

Use this 3-step structure for parking reform content:

### 1. Define the PROBLEM: Waste and costs
Make the connection between the policy and the costs. Use specific examples:
- Each parking spot can raise rent by hundreds of dollars per month—whether residents use it or not
- Communities lose out on new housing when parking mandates eat up too much space or budget
- Local businesses struggle to open when they don't have the space or budget for excess parking
- Trees need to be cut down to comply with parking mandates
- Asphalt traps heat and threatens people's health

### 2. Illustrate the SOLUTION: People and places
Move from zero-sum arguments about parking to what we want for our community:
- More home choices that local workers can afford
- Thriving Main Streets and revitalized downtown shopping
- More local businesses offering essential services like child care
- People-friendly neighborhoods with parks and tree-lined streets

### 3. Offer clear ACTION: Parking flexibility
Don't debate how much parking is right. Emphasize that needs vary by location and use, and that flexibility is commonsense.

Example: "We all benefit by dropping wasteful parking mandates and instead allowing more flexibility for homebuilders, businesses, and property owners to determine how much parking is needed for a specific site, location, and use."

## Research-Based Tips

### 1. Focus on convenience and connection, not "car dependence"
Avoid leading with suggestions to drive less or switch to transit. These put people on the defensive. Instead, switch the frame from "Where will I park?" to "What's it like to live here?" Emphasize safe, inviting neighborhoods where homes, services, and shops are accessible.

### 2. Focus on real harms that impact people RIGHT NOW
Opponents raise "what if" scenarios about future parking shortages. Redirect to specific examples of how current rules harm people today—and how we can undo those harms.

Top-performing example: "Strict parking mandates can keep our communities from getting the services we need. For example, one local childcare center was ready to start building but had to be canceled because local mandates required parking they didn't need and couldn't afford."

### 3. Connect parking mandates to affordability
Cite monthly rent impacts, not construction costs. "Each parking spot can raise monthly rent by over $200" is more persuasive than "construction costs $50,000 for each spot."

### 4. Use visuals and vivid language
Paint a picture: big empty parking lots, acres of asphalt, sterile strip-mall development. Contrast with vibrant Main Streets, tree-lined shopping areas, charming neighborhoods.

### 5. Emphasize local environmental impacts people can see and feel
More persuasive than abstract global climate appeals:
- Trees being cut down
- Pollution in local waterways from stormwater runoff
- Dangerous temperatures from asphalt heat islands
- Air pollution from sprawling development

### 6. Position local people as experts
"Local homebuilders, property owners, and business people should have flexibility to decide what parking makes sense for a specific site." Elevate trusted community members who can tell stories about being held up by wasteful mandates.

## Top-Performing Message Examples

### Housing: Workers Message (effective with policymakers, +14pp with Black respondents)
"Housing is too unaffordable today because there are not enough homes to rent or buy that meet people's needs and budgets. Not having enough homes to rent or buy creates cutthroat competition and drives up prices. Right now, people our communities rely on—like teachers, childcare workers, and service and retail workers—can't find homes they can afford in the cities they serve. And when there are not enough homes, the wealthy will always outbid working people, and everyone else has to move farther away. Allowing more homes of all shapes and sizes, like fourplexes and apartments, makes our cities and towns more affordable for local workers, shortening commutes, helping local businesses hire locally, and supporting a thriving community for everyone."

### Housing: Starter Homes Message (most effective across all income/education levels)
"If you or someone you know is looking to buy a home, you know that housing is just too unaffordable today. Most people can't afford the big, expensive homes on the market, McMansions and luxury renovated houses. It is almost impossible to find an affordable starter home, townhouse, or condo, to get a foothold. Our communities can change current laws to allow more homes of all shapes and sizes that people can afford, from townhomes and duplexes, to fourplexes and sixplexes, to apartments. Allowing more home choices will give people the opportunity to own their own home, build wealth, and build up solid foundations of economic stability and opportunity."

### Parking: Local Businesses Message (81% found convincing across all demographics)
"When we force locally-owned mom-n-pop shops, restaurants, and services to build big, expensive parking lots—especially in older storefronts and on smaller lots—they get blocked from opening or expanding or take their business further out of central, convenient locations in town. These small, local businesses are the heart of our communities, bringing people together and creating vibrant, inviting neighborhoods. We all benefit by dropping wasteful parking mandates and instead allowing more flexibility for homebuilders, businesses, and property owners to determine how much parking is needed for a specific site, location, and use. Parking flexibility means more local businesses can open and succeed."

### Parking: Protecting Beloved Places (80% found convincing—top performer overall)
"Parking flexibility helps protect what's unique and inviting about our communities, from charming town centers to historic shopping streets and downtown buildings. By allowing updates and new uses for older buildings and businesses, we can make it possible for beloved neighborhoods to invite new businesses and investment, including renovations and new storefront openings, without knocking down adjacent buildings for new parking lots. Parking flexibility encourages local businesses in cherished historic buildings and protects unique, local places from unneeded asphalt."

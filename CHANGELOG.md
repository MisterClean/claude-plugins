All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.6] - 2026-01-25

### Changed

- **gridstatus-api** skill (v1.2.0 → v1.3.0): Rewrote to prefer Python SDK over curl
  - **CRITICAL**: Direct curl API has date filtering issues on free tier - returns stale sample data
  - Python SDK correctly handles date parameters and returns current data
  - Simplified skill structure with "Standard Query Template" using heredoc pattern
  - Added "Why Not curl?" section explaining the free tier API limitation
  - Removed curl-first examples; SDK is now the primary method
  - Added uv-based installation for dependency isolation
  - Streamlined troubleshooting table with SDK-first guidance

## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-25

### Changed

- **gridstatus-api** skill (v1.1.0 → v1.2.0): Enhanced for common user questions
  - Added "Quick Answers" section for common questions (energy consumption, current load, dataset discovery)
  - Added prominent "Energy Calculations" section with conversion formulas (MW to MWh)
  - Improved dataset discovery workflow using `/v1/datasets` metadata API
  - Enhanced troubleshooting for Python SDK numpy issues with curl fallback guidance
  - Added `/v1/datasets/{dataset_id}` single dataset metadata endpoint documentation
  - Added energy consumption calculation examples to common-queries.md
  - Added "Most Recent Data Point" query pattern (`order=desc&limit=1`)
  - Documented 455+ available datasets across 10 ISOs
- Updated root README.md with improved gridstatus-api description
- Updated skills/README.md with gridstatus-api feature highlights and meme image

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-13

### Changed

- **gridstatus-api** skill (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0): Updated based on real-world API testing
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Corrected API parameter names - use `start_time`/`end_time` for curl, `start`/`end` for Python SDK
  - Added documentation for standardized datasets (`pjm_standardized_hourly`, `pjm_standardized_5_min`)
  - Clarified zone-specific data access via columns (e.g., `load.comed`) not filters
  - Added energy calculation formulas for hourly and 5-minute data
  - Enhanced troubleshooting section with common errors and fixes
  - Added timezone parameter guidance (`timezone="market"` for local time)
  - Documented curl as fallback when Python SDK has dependency issues
  - Added zone-specific load query examples for PJM
